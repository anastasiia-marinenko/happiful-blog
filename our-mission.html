            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <hr>
            <p id="thesis">Here at Happiful, our mission is to create a healthier, happier and more sustainable society
                and to challenge the stigma around mental health. And, we’re sticklers for practising what we
                publish
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><i><b>Happiful Magazine</b></i> was created by two sisters, Emma and Aimi, driven by their shared passion
                for
                mental health and wellbeing. In 2005, they launched Counselling Directory, a platform designed to
                connect people with professional therapists in their local area.</p>

            <p>Over the years, their vision expanded, and they introduced four additional wellness directories focusing
                on life coaching, hypnotherapy, nutrition, and complementary therapies. Happiful Magazine became the
                next step in their mission—to spread awareness that help and support are always within reach.</p>

            <p>Our goal is to share stories, experiences, and resources that support the wellbeing of everyone in our
                community. At the heart of everything we do are our core values. We believe that if we’re not passionate
                about our work, our readers won’t be either.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>The Happiful team is based in Surrey, UK, and we are currently at around 40 team members. Together we
                work on the wellbeing directories and magazine. From our award-winning customer service team to our
                incredible team of developers, we are all passionate about the four pillars of our mission.</p>

            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>It’s important to us that we strive to achieve our mission in everything we do, while maintaining our
                family values. The Happiful mission consists of four statements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>To raise awareness of mental health</b> – because we all have it. We are passionate about
                    informing and
                    supporting people who are looking for help.</li>
                <li><b>To bring people together</b> – whether it’s connecting people to professional help, or building
                    friendships in the office. Together we are dedicated to making a difference.</li>
                <li><b>To end the stigma of mental health.</b> Mental illness and poor mental health are not things to
                    be
                    ashamed about, we are proud to lead the way in allowing people to publish their stories with their
                    own voice.</li>
                <li><b>To have a positive impact on the world around us</b> – through looking after our staff, our
                    readers, our
                    society and the planet.</li>
            </ol>
